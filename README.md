# IngestRSS üóûÔ∏èüí¶

OpenRSS is an AWS-based RSS feed processing system that automatically fetches, processes, and stores articles from specified RSS feeds.




## Customization

- To modify the CloudFormation templates, edit the YAML files in `src/infra/cloudformation/`.
- To change the Lambda function's behavior, modify the Python files in `src/lambda_function/src/`.
- To add or remove RSS feeds, update the `rss_feeds.json` file.


## Monitoring
The Lambda function logs its activities to CloudWatch Logs. You can monitor the function's performance and any errors through the AWS CloudWatch console.
