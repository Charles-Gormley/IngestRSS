       "array(['Let’s face it. The world of team building activities has evolved beyond trust falls and awkward ice breakers. CEOs, entrepreneurs, professors—you name it—are constantly on the hunt for dynamic ways to strengthen their teams. Why? Because a connected team is the powerhouse behind every great achievement. Imagine transforming mundane meetings into epic adventures or dull Fridays into days buzzing with excitement and laughter. With the right mix, you can catapult your group from mere co-workers to a unified force ready to tackle any challenge head-on. Ready to get started? Let’s take a look at some team building activities that you might want to use.\\n\\nThe Importance of Team Building for Company Culture\\n\\nGone are the days when “team building” was merely a buzzword. Nowadays, it’s essential for nurturing company culture and ensuring everyone feels like part of something bigger than their task list. These activities are all about boosting morale, enhancing communication, and fostering trust among team members.\\n\\nEngaging in a variety of team-strengthening activities can dismantle the walls separating different sectors or levels within organizations. By forcing employees out of their digital workspaces, they have the opportunity to learn about their colleagues’ strengths and interests, which can help in future projects. Not only is this a great opportunity for employees to build trust, but it’s also a chance to foster spaces where individuals are appreciated.\\n\\nSo buckle up. We’re diving deep into this world—examining everything from quick icebreakers perfect for remote teams to full-scale corporate retreats designed to recharge and inspire. You’ll get the inside scoop on how these strategies not only bring people together but also spark creativity, boost morale, and drive productivity. Embarking on this journey, we’ll reshape the way your team interacts and collaborates.\\n\\nLearn How You Could Get Your First (Or Next) Paid Speaking Gig In 90 Days or Less We receive thousands of applications every day, but we only work with the top 5% of speakers. Book a FREE call with our team to get started — you’ll learn why the vast majority of our students get a paid speaking gig within 90 days of finishing our program. Get Started\\n\\nInnovative Food-Based Team Building Challenges\\n\\nWhat better way to connect your team than through food? Whether you’re making it or eating it, meals are a great way to build your team’s morale.\\n\\nHosting a Guacamole Making Contest\\n\\nHosting a guacamole challenge is not only a delicious way to dive into food-related team building activities, but it’s also ripe with opportunities for creativity and collaboration.\\n\\nGather your team members around the kitchen counter or even virtually via video call. Everyone gets the basic ingredients: avocados, limes, onions, and tomatoes. But here’s where it gets interesting: add some mystery ingredients into the mix. Think mangoes, pomegranate seeds or even chocolate. The goal? To create an award-winning guac masterpiece.\\n\\nThe beauty of this activity lies in its simplicity yet ability to spark conversations and laughter among participants. And hey, there’s always tasty guac at the end.\\n\\nOrganizing a Lunch & Learn Session\\n\\nEating together has always been an excellent way for people to bond. Combine that with learning something new during lunchtime and you have “Lunch & Learn.” Pick topics relevant to your work environment or completely off-the-wall subjects that catch everyone by surprise. Truly, these gatherings serve as culinary bonding experiences, blending the art of conversation with delightful cuisine to spark insightful dialogues among team members.\\n\\nWhat makes Lunch & Learns particularly great is their flexibility. They work equally well whether you’re part of a remote workforce dialing in from different parts of the globe or sitting across each other in the office cafeteria.\\n\\nIn essence, Lunch & Learns offer both nourishment and knowledge. Whether hosting a lively guacamole making contest or embarking on thought-provoking Lunch & Learns sessions, this combination boosts morale, strengthens connections, and encourages teamwork.\\n\\nOutdoor and Adventure-Focused Team Activities\\n\\nChances are your team already spends plenty of time indoors sitting at desks. So why not get them up and moving with some outdoor activities? While these team building activities are dependent on weather, they can be a nice change of pace and environment for your employees.\\n\\nPlanning a Cornhole Tournament\\n\\nTo get your team outside, try organizing a cornhole tournament. The beauty of cornhole is that anyone can play, regardless of fitness level or sports prowess. Here’s how you make it happen:\\n\\nPick Your Teams: Randomize to mix things up and get folks interacting outside their usual cliques.\\n\\nRandomize to mix things up and get folks interacting outside their usual cliques. Set up the Brackets: Make sure everyone gets a fair shot by organizing games in brackets—just like March Madness.\\n\\nMake sure everyone gets a fair shot by organizing games in brackets—just like March Madness. The Prize: Yes, there should be one. Whether it’s bragging rights, a goofy trophy, or lunch on the boss, have something for that winning duo.\\n\\nKickball Game Day for Team Bonding\\n\\nA little throwback never hurt anybody—especially if that throwback involves kickball. Remember recess? Well, this is recess all grown-up style. To set this day ablaze with excitement here’s what you need to do:\\n\\nCreate Teams Ahead Of Time: We’re not picking teams old school playground style—that way nobody feels left out. Lay Down Some Ground Rules: Safety first. Also decide how competitive or casual you want the game vibe to be. Celebrate Afterwards: No matter who wins or loses, celebrate together afterwards because you’re all on the same work team after all.\\n\\nBeyond being plain old fun, outdoor and sports-related team building activities like cornhole and kickball boost morale while breaking down barriers between group members in ways traditional exercises can’t touch. Who knows? You might just end up starting an annual tradition that becomes legendary within your company culture.\\n\\nEngaging Indoor Gaming and Strategy Sessions\\n\\nFor teams that are less inclined to engage in physical outdoor activities, there are always plenty of indoor games to try instead. With tabletop games, you not only have the opportunity to exercise a little healthy competition, you also have the chance to strike up conversations with teammates during game play.\\n\\nSetting Up a Dungeons & Dragons Campaign\\n\\nDive into the world of Dungeons & Dragons, where fantasy meets strategy in the ultimate team-building activity. Picture this: your work team, transformed into a band of adventurers, navigating treacherous lands filled with puzzles and enemies. Beyond mere entertainment, this creative exercise evolves into a profound workshop on devising solutions and nurturing imaginative thought. The best part is that no two campaigns are ever the same. As you roll dice to determine your fate, you’ll find that communication is key. You need to talk, plan, strategize together to overcome challenges thrown at you by the Dungeon Master.\\n\\nBoard Game Night for Strategic Thinking\\n\\nIf Dungeons & Dragons isn’t quite your speed, consider hosting a board game night instead. It’s another great way of sharpening those strategic minds in an environment that encourages friendly competition. Consider some of the games below for your team.\\n\\nTicket to Ride: Build train routes across countries or continents—great for fostering planning skills.\\n\\nBuild train routes across countries or continents—great for fostering planning skills. Catan: Gather resources and build settlements—perfect for negotiation tactics and resource management skills.\\n\\nGather resources and build settlements—perfect for negotiation tactics and resource management skills. Pandemic: A fight against time as players collaborate to stop global outbreaks—a true test of teamwork under pressure.\\n\\nA fight against time as players collaborate to stop global outbreaks—a true test of teamwork under pressure. Forbidden Island: Work together as a team to collect four relics before the island sinks—great for collaborative team-work and communication.\\n\\nEach of these games requires clear communication, forward-thinking moves, and swift adaptability when plans go awry. Indeed, engaging in these strategic games can even enhance vital abilities such as analytical reasoning and team synergy. With these indoor games, you have a chance at bringing out the best in teammates while building bonds strong enough to tackle any corporate challenges.\\n\\nBudget-Friendly Team Building Solutions\\n\\nSometimes planning team building activities can be tricky, especially when you don’t have money to spend on supplies. If this is you, don’t worry—you still have plenty of options at your disposal.\\n\\nCreative No-Cost Team Building Activities\\n\\nIf you’re on a tight budget, no sweat. We have some team building solutions that don’t require you to break the bank. Here are a few creative exercises that will have your team laughing, learning, and growing closer—all without reaching for the company credit card.\\n\\nThe “Two Truths and a Lie” Icebreaker: It’s classic but golden. Everyone shares two truths about themselves and one lie. The rest guess which is which. You’d be amazed by the revelations that come to light.\\n\\nIt’s classic but golden.

Robert Smith of Planet Money carries a printed copy of Dan Harmon’s Story Circle around in his wallet. But, as spot-on as the Story Circle is, if it’s not drawn on a napkin, it’s just less satisfying. (Joking)\\n\\nI first got the idea of drawing story structures on napkins from Bradley Campbell. He’s much better at it than I am. You can see for yourself at the post for the HowSound episode “My Kingdom for Some Structure.” Bradley and I chatted about the sketches he made for This American Life and Radiolab and All Things Considered and others.\\n\\nLater, I took pen to paper for “The ‘e,'” perhaps my favorite story structure. The drawings? Not so much.\\n\\nNow, the broken narrative. If memory serves, I first heard about it from Roy Peter Clark of the Poynter Institute. The broken narrative works like this:\\n\\nThe straight line is the narrative of the story. This happened then this happened then this happened. . .\\n\\nAt an appropriate point in the narrative, the story takes a step to the side. The writer puts the narrative on hold to provide context or history or reported information. That’s the “broken” part of the arrow above.\\n\\nThen, slyly (if the writing is good), the narrative seamlessly continues. This happened then this happened. . . until it’s time for another break in the story for more context.\\n\\nAnd so on. . .\\n\\nNPR’s Greg Warner blew me away recently with his skillful use of the broken narrative on an episode of Rough Translation called “The Congo We Listen To.” Greg and I dissect the broken narrative in the opening to that story on this edition of HowSound.\",\n",

I commend our employees, contractors and partners who have come together and worked to make this transition a reality.”\\n\\nSherco Solar’s initial connection to the Upper Midwest grid occurred in late October, serving customers across the region with more than 220 megawatts of low-cost solar power. Two additional connection phases will come online in 2025 and 2026. Once complete, Sherco Solar’s combined capacity of 710 MW will provide enough clean energy to power 150,000 homes across the Upper Midwest and replace the capacity of the nearby Sherco plant’s first coal unit that retired last year.\\n\\nSherco Solar will provide the lowest-cost solar on Xcel Energy’s Upper Midwest system. The project represents an investment of about $1.1 billion in clean energy infrastructure.\\n\\nSherco Solar is creating 400 good-paying union construction jobs, plus 12 ongoing operations and maintenance jobs. The project provides an opportunity for participants in Xcel Energy’s Power Up workforce and development program, which the PUC and Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development were key in shaping. The workforce program is designed to offer opportunities to people who are underrepresented in the energy industry and building trades.\\n\\n“Sherco Solar is creating hundreds of jobs with family-supporting wages for IBEW 292 members, who are keeping the lights on for Minnesotans while building the clean energy infrastructure that will power the state for decades to come,” said Jeff Heimerl, business manager of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 292. “Nearly 200 IBEW members helped deliver the first phase of Sherco Solar, and we’re already hard at work on the next phases of the project as we help the state meet its 100% carbon-free energy production goal.”\\n\\nThe project will also contribute an estimated $350 million in local economic benefits to Sherburne County communities as the Sherco coal plant is retired in stages by 2030.\\n\\nNews item from Xcel Energy',\n",

       "       \"North Carolina is fresh off a trouncing of American University, outscoring the Eagles 61-24 in the second half and cruising to a 52-point victory.\\n\\nIt’s still early, but through three games — one against the AP No. 1 ranked team — pieces are starting to fit into place for this revamped Tar Heel squad. It’s evident how much talent runs up and down Coach Hubert Davis’s roster, but the designation of roles was a huge question mark approaching 2024-25. Putting the puzzle together is an art, especially in college sports, that takes time. North Carolina looks to have taken a significant step in that process with point guard Elliot Cadeau.\\n\\nThe 20-year-old reclassified into the 2023 recruiting class, skipping his senior year of high school and joining the Tar Heels two summers ago. Cadeau was highly touted nationally at his position and across all, being the first five-star to enroll in Chapel Hill since Caleb Love in 2020.\\n\\nCadeau’s emergence in this young season shouldn't imply his freshman campaign as a waste. The guard led North Carolina in assists and contributed quality control of the offense with a sprinkle of points in every contest last year. He was arguably lost in the shadow of RJ Davis — which was easy to do — and not quite ready to be the surefire prospect out of Link Academy represented in pure production.\\n\\nThe main blemish on Cadeau’s player profile in 2023-24 was his inability to shoot, specifically from beyond the arc. After being profiled as an average shooter in high school, he shot 18.9% (10-53) from three-point land a year ago. It hurt the Tar Heels in a big way.\\n\\n“You will not recognize him” is what Hubert Davis said to the ACC media ahead of this season regarding the growth of Cadeau. Update: Coach was right.\\n\\nIn three games, Elliot Cadeau is averaging 15.7 points and 7.7 assists, shooting 48.1% from the field. It's a small sample size, but the sophomore is 40% from deep, shooting 3-4 in the opener against Elon. He’s a completely different player.\\n\\nWhat doesn't show up as blaring in the stat sheet is his mind-boggling vision with the ball in his hands. The assists aren't weighted as they should be, as some of Cadeau’s dimes are hands on head crazy. He passes his teammates open and complements that with an athletic burst with the basketball, leaving 1-on-1 defenders nearly helpless. There’s a certain sense of control when the New Jersey native directs the offense, and everything else seems to be falling perfectly into place beyond that.\\n\\nIf you’ve been watching close enough, there may be something else that's caught your eye regarding Elliot Cadeau. He’s a special teammate.\\n\\nWhen RJ Davis gets his name announced in pregame introductions, Cadeau sprints back from the huddle to praise the superstar guard as he makes his way onto the court. No one was more animated after electrifying plays on Friday night than Cadeau, with the main instance coming after the Jalen Washington slam as North Carolina was riding heavy momentum.\\n\\nPUT IT ON A TSHIRT!!! ️ pic.twitter.com/WUmYnBC8z8 — Carolina Basketball (@UNC_Basketball) November 16, 2024\\n\\nHave you seen Cadeau’s reactions on the bench when walk-on’s John Holbrook and Dante Mayo got in the scoring column? He nearly runs onto the court celebrating his teammates in complete pandemonium with the rest of the bench.\\n\\nWhen it comes to choosing someone to command this team, Elliot Cadeau is surely making his case. The combination of leadership, selflessness and rising production makes him one of, if not the best, point guard in the ACC on a team with so many weapons surrounding him. His early success has also allowed defensive attention to be rationed, as Trimble, Davis and Cadeau are all seen as scoring threats.\\n\\nThe shooting woes held Cadeau back in 2023, and he clearly did something about them. But luckily for us, that’s not the lone piece of his game that’s risen to the next level. If the first three games were implicative of what’s to come, it’s going to be a special season for the sophomore guard and the Tar Heels.\",\n",

       "       'There was a lot working against Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines when it launched on this day back in 2004. Nobody wants to launch up against a game as hotly anticipated as Half-Life 2, let alone be pushed out half-finished due to a bizarre corporate mandate to launch on the same day as said game — which, incidentally, used the same brand-new engine as V:TM-B was built in, but as proprietary in-house technology rather than via a third-party licence, and so very much getting the better end of the deal.\\n\\nTo see this content please enable targeting cookies. Manage cookie settings\\n\\nUltimately, looking back on the launch debacle that surrounded Bloodlines just shows you how radically the games industry has changed in the past 20 years. If the same scenario were to play out today, you\\'d probably see the publishers overseeing a video game tie-in to a relatively niche TTRPG doing everything in their power to avoid launching on the same day as such an obvious GOTY candidate. In fact, the launch would likely be pushed back several months to minimise clashing over the audience\\'s attentions, which ironically would have been exactly what Bloodlines\\' developer Troika Games wanted and needed but never got.\\n\\nBut there\\'s also the fact that Bloodlines managed to gain a fair amount of popularity quite quickly despite its underbaked launch state. Even before it gained the cult classic status it\\'s best known for today, this wasn\\'t a game that required reassessment from a later generation of players, and its reputation initially grew out of perseverance from the fans who were already there at the time.\\n\\nMany fond memories of Bloodlines owe a debt to the dedicated modders whose work on post-launch patches was crucial to ensuring its legacy. However, I really must stress that this screenshot comes from a totally unmodded version of the game. | Image credit: Troika Games / Activision\\n\\nAgain, that\\'s something that wouldn\\'t happen in 2024, when a theoretically decent game with performance issues not patched out on Day 1 is more often than not dismissed as \"mid\" and consigned to the status of a minor historical footnote, as players turn their attentions to any of the dozens of other games that launched that week. And honestly, who can blame them?\\n\\nThe world of two decades ago was quite different: fewer games doing the rounds, and slower access to the games there were (digital distribution was still in its infancy, remember: Steam was a mere year old at this point, and still only sold games made directly by Valve) meant that something like Bloodlines could still emerge with a respectable 80% average critical score, rapidly become something of a darling among players, and even pick up a modest handful of end-of-year awards despite launching in mid-November on top of everything else that it had to contend with.\\n\\nShout out to my main gal, the female Tremere PC, one of the 14 playable character archetypes you choose from in Bloodlines. What she lacks in raw physical strength, she more than makes up for in her ability to suspend her enemies in mid-air using the blood she magically boils in their veins. | Image credit: Troika Games / Activision\\n\\nSadly, the purgatorial status of the Bloodlines IP continues to this day. Given that Troika Games folded not long after Bloodlines\\' launch, most fans knew better than to expect a sequel. So when one was announced in 2019 — with an initial release window that would broadly coincide with the original game\\'s 15th anniversary, but also risked clashing with the then-intended launch date for the hotly-awaited, GOTY-tipped Cyberpunk 2077 — the pleasant surprise was tempered by nervous jokes about generational curses.\\n\\nFive years and numerous delays later, of course, Bloodlines 2 still hasn\\'t launched — and has changed almost beyond recognition, morphing from a closely-moulded direct sequel developed by Hardsuit Labs to a looser spiritual successor rebuilt from the ground up by The Chinese Room. By the sounds of things, 2025 might just be the year we finally get our hands on V:TM-B2, but it\\'s fair to say that those half-joking predictions of a troubled production proved more accurate than even the prognosticators themselves anticipated.\\n\\nOne of V:TM-B\\'s many strengths on display: an early example of digital tourism via the game\\'s loving rendition of a seedy late-night Los Angeles spread across four hub maps. | Image credit: Troika Games / Activision\\n\\nIn truth, though — and speaking from the heart here, as someone who still considers Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines quite possibly their single favourite video game of all time even two decades later — I\\'m not that worried about Bloodlines 2.\\n\\nNot because it\\'s better viewed in the context of the fact that there have actually been 11 official VTM video games (plus numerous sanctioned VTM game jam titles) released in the past two decades that weren\\'t Bloodlines sequels, but which did demonstrate that the IP is versatile enough to support a steady supply of good games, even if they mostly don\\'t have the scope and reach to set the world on fire. And not because I have faith in The Chinese Room to deliver a decent World of Darkness-flavoured Dishonored-style imsim that bears little relation to the original but stands up well enough on its own — although, for what it\\'s worth, I do actually think that\\'ll be the case.\\n\\nTo say nothing of the half-dozen non-VTM World of Darkness games that have launched over the past 20 years, including several from Werewolf: The Apocalypse. | Image credit: Troika Games / Activision\\n\\nI\\'ve mentioned this already in our end-of-year video round-ups for 2023, but last year\\'s resounding Game of the Year winner Baldur\\'s Gate 3 has in many ways already scratched my itch for a modern Vampire: The Masquerade follow-up. As a deeply engrossing RPG based on a popular tabletop setting, made exceptional by the strength of its writing, world-building, and performances (and even with a hot-yet-troubled vampire in a key role), BG3 already proved that the V:TM-B formula could be one of the most winning concepts in video games if a developer was given the time, space, and — crucially — funding and resources needed to make a game that lived up to all that truly excellent potential.\\n\\nViewed through this more holistic lens, Bloodlines\\' legacy has already come full circle. A throwback title in the same vein became the first video game ever to win all five major GOTY awards; if ever a point could be comprehensively proven in a field as subjective as art and entertainment, this one has been now. Bloodlines 2 can be what it needs to be — whether it ends up being beloved, reviled, or just quickly forgotten — and at the end of the day, the original Bloodlines will still be that messy but wonderful cult classic that set the bar for RPG storytelling in video games.',\n",
       "       'In the “That’s Not Even a State” portion of the non-conference schedule for the Texas Longhorns, the Mississippi Valley State Delta Devils arrived at the Moody Center in Austin ranked dead last in Division I in BartTorvik.com’s adjusted efficiency metrics and left as 89-43 losers on Saturday after the Longhorns outscored the Delta Devils 56-20 in the second half.\\n\\nThat meant that head coach Rodney Terry’s team scuffled to a 33-23 lead in the first half as Texas freshman guard Tre Johnson only scored one point on two shot attempts in 16 minutes as the Longhorns inexplicably failed to create any separation.\\n\\nIn the second half, Texas rolled Mississippi Valley State, hitting 18 of their final 20 shot attempts in making 77.8-percent of their shot attempts, relentlessly attacking downhill and winning one-on-one battles with 11 points in transition and 15 layups, including five dunks.\\n\\nThe offensive outburst included Johnson coming alive after halftime, scoring 17 points on 6-of-7 shooting with three made three-pointers. Texas senior forward Arthur Kaluma tied Johnson with a game-high 18 points in another efficient performance for the Creighton and Kansas State transfer, making 5-of-8 shot attempts and getting the line to convert 8-of-10 from the charity stripe, adding eight rebounds, two assists, two steals, and a block.\\n\\nAs Mississippi State struggled to defend without fouling — committing 25 in the game — Texas attempted 36 free throws compared to 45 shots from the floor.\\n\\nThe Longhorns dominated some key statistical categories, posting a 44-18 margin in points in the paint, 16-2 on fast-break points, 21-4 in points off turnovers, and 7-0 in blocks.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that the Delta Devils are an awful basketball team the Longhorns should have buried in the first half. Instead, Johnson’s big second half was necessary to create separation.\\n\\nDown the stretch, the performance of freshman forward Jamie Vinson was impressive with six points on three dunks, but there will also be plenty for Terry and his staff to critique before traveling to Brooklyn to face Syracuse next Thursday.',\n",
       "       'LOADING ERROR LOADING\\n\\nThe House Ethics Committee deadlocked Wednesday over whether to release details of its investigation of attorney general nominee Matt Gaetz for sexual misconduct and drug use, the panel’s top Democrat said.\\n\\nRep. Susan Wild (D-Penn.) told reporters the evenly split committee ― a rarity in Congress ― saw members vote along party lines on whether to release the report, denying the majority needed for the report’s disclosure.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“There was not an agreement by the committee to release the report,” Rep. Michael Guest (R-Miss.), chairman of the panel, said as he left the committee meeting, which lasted for several hours.\\n\\nWild said she did not want Guest’s remarks to be taken to mean there was consensus decision not to release the report.\\n\\n“I do not want the American public or anyone else to think that Mr. Guests’ characterization of what transpired today would be some sort of indication that the committee had unanimity or consensus on this issue,” Wild said.\\n\\nThe development leaves in limbo the fate of the probe’s potential findings as the Senate faces the prospect of having to vote to install as the nation’s top cop a man once accused of sex trafficking. Gaetz, a former Florida congressman, has denied the charges, and a federal criminal investigation into his activities was closed with no charges being filed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGaetz resigned from the House soon after being named, a move that reportedly came days before the committee was set to release its report on him. Because the House Ethics Committee only has jurisdiction over House members, the resignation ordinarily would have ended the probe without any further action.\\n\\nBut with Gaetz being nominated to head the Department of Justice, some argue that the usual past practice of closing the investigation without a public report should be ignored.\\n\\nPresident-elect Donald Trump’s pick of Gaetz is one of several selections that have caused some unease among Republicans. In addition to Gaetz, Trump chose Fox News weekend television host Pete Hegseth to be his secretary of defense and former congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard to be his national security adviser.\\n\\nBut Gaetz’s nomination appears to be the most troubled of the picks so far. In a June statement, the committee said “certain of the allegations” merited further review, and Gaetz was being looked at due to allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, accepting improper gifts and seeking to obstruct the government’s investigations of him.\\n\\nSo far, Trump has stood by Gaetz, even as many Republicans were shocked by the choice. On Wednesday, Gaetz returned to Capitol Hill to meet with some of the senators who would be deciding his nomination’s fate.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nDemocrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which would be the first to consider Gaetz, asked the Justice Department Wednesday to hand over its documents relating to the investigation that led to no charges being filed. Democrats have a majority on the committee until early January.\\n\\n“The grave public allegations against Mr. Gaetz speak directly to his fitness to serve as the chief law enforcement officer for the federal government. The unanswered questions regarding Mr. Gaetz’s alleged conduct are particularly significant given that his associate, Joel Greenberg, pleaded guilty to the sex trafficking charge for which Mr. Gaetz was also investigated,” the Democratic senators, led by Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), wrote.\\n\\nIn the House, the deadlock at Ethics prompted not one but two attempts by Democrats to force a floor vote on whether to release the report.\\n\\nRep. Sean Casten (D-Ill.) and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-Tenn.) both notified the House they would introduce privileged resolutions to require the ethics panel to release its findings. Privileged resolutions are often used to try to get a quick House floor vote on an issue dealing with the standards of the House, such as censures or expulsions.\\n\\nBut given the congressional calendar, a vote on either resolution could be delayed into December, when public pressure may have lessened.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n“Our hope is that the Ethics Committee releases the report before then so we don’t have to deal with this,” Casten told reporters. But he did not sound optimistic that would happen.\\n\\n“Every Republican in that House just endorsed someone for president who is an adjudicated rapist. The fact that we have to ask whether Republicans will support making public allegations of sexual impropriety by someone who is trying to be the highest law enforcement officer in the country speaks volumes of the Republican Party,” he said.\\n\\nWhile those who worked side by side with Gaetz expressed the most wonderment he had been named to head the nation’s federal law enforcement establishment, a new Economist/YouGov poll out Wednesday found public opinion evenly split.',\n",

That loss helped Miami move up a spot in both the rankings and seedings projection at this point of the season.\\n\\nMiami moves up to 8th ranked team in CFP rankings for week 3. Also moves back up to 3rd seed after BYU's loss. — StateOfTheU.com (@TheStateOfTheU) November 20, 2024\\n\\nMiami continues to be the highest ranked ACC team at this point of the year. Following CFP logic, that means Miami’s projected as the eventual ACC Champions, and thusly retain their top-4 seed and a bye, if the current rankings held true to the end of the year. Here is the full bracket and seeding, for your viewing pleasure:\\n\\nRegardless of present ranking, Miami is still in control of their own path to both the ACC Championship Game and College Football Playoff. Logically, it’s a simple path: win the rest of your games.\\n\\nAs it currently stands, Miami is in line for a first round bye. As the #3 seed, they would be in line to face the winner of 6 vs 11 game, currently ranked/seeded to be Penn State vs Georgia. But again, there’s a long way to go before any of this is finalized.\\n\\n2 regular season wins against Wake Forest and Syracuse would put Miami in the ACC Championship game. A win in the ACCCG would Put Miami in the top 4 as ACC Conference Champions and earn the Canes a bye to the quarterfinals.\\n\\nMiami returns to action on Saturday at Noon at home against Wake Forest on Senior Day. The game will kick at noon with nationwide coverage on ESPN.\\n\\nTime to go win!\\n\\nGo Canes\",\n",

       "       'It is becoming a bit difficult to follow all the new AI, RAG and LLM terminology, with new concepts popping up almost every week. Which ones are important, and here to stay? Which ones are just old stuff rebranded with a new name for marketing purposes? In this new series, I start with chunking, indexing, scoring, and agents. These words can have different meanings depending on the context. It is noteworthy that recently, No-GPU specialized LLMs are gaining considerable traction. This is especially true for enterprise versions. My discussion here is based on my experience building such models, from scratch. It applies both to RAG and LLM.\\n\\nChunking\\n\\nAll large language models and RAG apps use a corpus or document repository as input source. For instance, top Internet websites, or a corporate corpus. LLMs produce nice grammar and English prose, while RAG systems focus on retrieving useful information in a way similar to Google search, but much better and with a radically different approach. Either way, when building such models, one of the very first steps is chunking.\\n\\nAs the name indicates, chunking consists in splitting the corpus in small text entities. In some systems, text entities have a fixed size. However, a better solution is to use separators. In this case, text entities are JSON elements, parts of a web page, paragraphs, sentences, or subsections in PDF documents. In my xLLM system, text entities, besides standard text, also have a variable number of contextual fields such as agents, categories, parent categories, tags, related items, titles, URLs, images, and so on. A critical parameter is the average size of these text entities. In xLLM, you can optimize the size via real-time fine-tuning.\\n\\nIndexing\\n\\nChunking and indexing go together. By indexing, I mean assigning an ID (or index) to each text entity. This is different from automatically creating an index for your corpus, a task known as auto-indexing and soon available in xLLM, along with cataloging.\\n\\nThe goal is to efficiently retrieve relevant text entities stored in a database, thanks to the text entity IDs accessible in memory. In particular, a backend table maps each corpus token (multi-token for xLLM) to the list of text entities that contain them. Text entities are represented by their IDs. Then, when processing a prompt, you first extract prompt tokens, match them to tokens in the corpus, and eventually to text entities that contain them, using a local transposed version of the backend table in question, restricted to prompt tokens. The end result is a list of candidate text entities to choose from (or to blend and turn into prose), when displaying prompt results.\\n\\nAgents\\n\\nSometimes the word agent is synonym to action: composing an email, solving a math problem, or producing and running some Python code as requested by the user. In this case, LLM may use an external API to execute the action. However, here, by agent, I mean the type of information the user wants to retrieve: a summary, definitions, URLs, references, best practices, PDFs, datasets, images, instructions about filling a form, and so on.\\n\\nStandard LLMs try to guess the intent of the user from the prompt. In short, they automatically assign agents to a prompt. However, a better alternative consists in offering a selection of potential agents to the user, in the prompt menu. In xLLM, agents are assigned post-crawling to text entities, as one of the contextual fields. Agent assignment is performed with a clustering algorithm applied to the corpus, or via simple pattern matching. Either way, it is done very early on in the backend architecture. Then, it is easy to retrieve text entities matching specific agents coming from the prompt.\\n\\nRelevancy Scores\\n\\nIf a prompt triggers 50 candidate text entities, you need to choose a subset to display in the prompt results, to not overwhelm the user. Even if the number is much smaller, it is still a good idea to use scores and show them in prompt results: it gives the user an idea of how confident your LLM is about its answer as a whole, or about parts of the answer. To achieve this goal, you assign a score to each candidate text entity.\\n\\nIn xLLM, the computation of the relevancy score, for a specific prompt and a specific text entity, is a combination of the following elements. Each of these elements has its own sub-score.\\n\\nThe number of prompt multi-tokens present in the text entity.\\n\\nMulti-tokens consisting of more than one word and rare multi-tokens (with low occurrence in the corpus) boost the relevancy score.\\n\\nPrompt multi-tokens present in a contextual field in the text entity (category, title, or tag) boost the relevancy score.\\n\\nThe size of the text entity has an impact on the score, favoring long over short text entities.\\n\\nYou then create a global score as follows, for each candidate text entity, with respect to the prompt. First, you sort text entities separately by each sub-score. You use the sub-ranks resulting from this sorting, rather than the actual values. Then you compute a weighted combination of these sub-ranks, for normalization purposes. That’s your final score. Finally, in prompt results, you display text entities with a global score above some threshold, or (say) the top 5. I call it the new “PageRank” for RAG/LLM, a replacement of the Google technology to decide on what to show to the user, for specific queries.\\n\\nFor detailed documentation, source code and sample input corpus (Fortune 100 company), see my books and articles on the topic, especially the new book “Building Disruptive AI & LLM Technology from Scratch”, listed at the top, here.\\n\\nAbout the Author\\n\\nVincent Granville is a pioneering GenAI scientist and machine learning expert, co-founder of Data Science Central (acquired by a publicly traded company in 2020), Chief AI Scientist at MLTechniques.com and GenAItechLab.com, former VC-funded executive, author (Elsevier) and patent owner — one related to LLM.

These murders have been fueled by anti-trans legislation that has worsened rates of violence, suicidality, homelessness, carceral abuse, health care disparities among trans people, the resolution states.\\n\\n“Our bicameral resolution is a powerful reminder that anti-trans rhetoric can cost lives,” said Rep. Sara Jacobs (D-CA), one of the four Equality Caucus members who introduced the resolution.\\n\\nInsights for the LGBTQ+ community Subscribe to our briefing for insights into how politics impacts the LGBTQ+ community and more.\\n\\n“So many people – especially youth – in the trans community are feeling scared and anxious right now, worried about their ability to get the health care they need, the future of their rights, and their safety,” Jacobs added. “Donald Trump’s anti-LGBTQ+ and anti-trans agenda will likely fuel this anxiety and violence against queer communities.”\\n\\nThe resolution notes that one-third of transgender women and one-half of transgender women who are Black, Middle Eastern, multiracial, or undocumented have ever experienced homelessness.\\n\\nIt also noted that one in 20 trans people attempt suicide each year, a rate that’s almost 10 times higher than the rest of the U.S. population. These rates are especially high amongst trans youth who have had their rights to gender-affirming care stripped in 26 states, despite such care being considered as the best standard by all major American medical associations.\\n\\nThe rollback of these medical rights have left parents afraid their children may be removed from their homes if they seek such care for their trans kids, the resolution adds.\\n\\nIt also notes that trans immigrants have died in American detention centers due to medical neglect, injury, and abuse at the hands of staff, and that trans inmates in jails and prisons also experience high levels of violence and discrimination.\\n\\nThe epidemic of violence has been hampered by a severe lack of data, the resolution states, highlighting a need for Congress and the executive branch to pass legislation and policies to protect and preserve trans people’s lives.\\n\\n“As anti-transgender rhetoric and legislation has increased in the United States over recent years, unfortunately so has anti-transgender violence,” said Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) who also co-introduced the resolution. “Too many transgender people have been killed just for living as their true, authentic selves. These instances, coupled with countless other acts of discrimination, are terrifying — but we won’t waver. I will never back down from fighting to ensure that all trans individuals can exist freely without fear of hate.”\\n\\nThe resolution was co-introduced by Jacobs and Jayapal, who are both members of the Equality Caucus’ Transgender Equality Task Force, as well as by Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI).\\n\\nEditor’s note: If you or someone you know is struggling or in crisis, help is available. Call or text 988 or chat at 988lifeline.org.

       "       'Re-engagement email examples: How to win back subscribers\\n\\nHave you noticed a significant number of your email list subscribers are no longer interacting with your content or following your calls to action? Then it may be time to start a re-engagement email campaign!\\n\\nThis can be a super effective email marketing strategy for winning back inactive subscribers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter all, one study indicates that the average email list decay rate, which is the percentage of subscribers who become inactive, is between 22% and 30% per year.\\n\\nThis means that, unless you’re cleaning your email list regularly, you’re likely sending a lot of messages into the void, never to be seen again.\\n\\nHowever, with re-engagement emails, you can start winning back some of those inactive subscribers. To be successful, though, you’ll need to keep some best practices in mind.\\n\\nSo, in this article, we’ll explore how to write win-back emails. We’ll also provide examples of some effective re-engagement email campaign strategies, from one-off surveys and free resources to entire email sequences.\\n\\nWhat is a re-engagement email?\\n\\nA re-engagement email, also called a “win-back email”, is a message you send to subscribers who have become inactive.\\n\\nThese emails aim to rekindle the interest of people who have not made a purchase or interacted with your brand for a while.\\n\\nRe-engagement email campaigns are a great strategy for sparking the interest of inactive subscribers before removing them from your mailing list. After all, emailing unresponsive subscribers with messages isn’t helping them or your business.\\n\\nBefore saying goodbye, however, a win-back email offers one final opportunity to reconnect and rebuild your customer relationship.\\n\\nUltimately, your goal is to re-establish a connection with those who seem to have lost interest in your products, services, or content.\\n\\nHere is an example re-engagement email from the newsletter pros at Marketing Brew. While the three-week inactivity timeline is pretty tight by most industry standards, they do a great job of ensuring their list is truly engaged with their content.\\n\\nThis way, they keep their email list clean, and ensure most of their messages aren’t getting lost in recipients’ spam folders.\\n\\nHow effective are re-engagement emails?\\n\\nWhile re-engagement email campaigns are a great way to win back subscribers, you can’t expect every inactive subscriber to become active again.\\n\\nMost email win-back campaigns have a success rate of 14% up to 29% in the best-case scenario.\\n\\nSeveral email marketing studies have found that sending a series of emails may be more effective than sending just a single email. A re-engagement sequence of three emails appears to be the sweet spot.\\n\\nOne recent study found that several different tactics will work, but no one tactic significantly outperformed the others.\\n\\nLater on, we’ll discuss how each of the methods below work, as well as provide a few additional examples. We’ll also tell you how to set up an effective re-engagement email sequence.\\n\\nRemember though, the method that works best for your business depends on the needs and interests of your unique audience.\\n\\nHow create a re-engagement email\\n\\nThe goal of your re-engagement email campaign is to get people interested in your emails again.\\n\\nSo, every element of your email – the subject line, the content, and the call-to-action – needs to support that goal.\\n\\nRe-Engagement email subject lines\\n\\nFor re-engagement email subject lines, the best ones specifically reference your goal: to win back your subscribers!\\n\\nHere is an example of an email from Tomasz Borys at Kissmetrics:\\n\\nYou can also take a more personal approach, like this email from Threadless:\\n\\nBoth subject lines work well. However, they each grab the reader’s attention in different ways.\\n\\nA simple “We miss you!” lets the subscriber know that you appreciate their readership. It also feels more conversational.\\n\\nOn the flip side, “Do you still want updates from us?” is direct and inquisitive. It tells the subscriber that you care about their time and want to make sure they get something out of the relationship.\\n\\nFor more inspiration, consider reviewing your past emails to see what’s working for your specific audience. Look for common themes like subject line length and tone to see what tends to work best for your target audience.\\n\\nYou can also try using personalization, like including your subscribers’ first names in the subject line. It’s no secret that personalization helps you connect with your subscribers and stand out a little more in the inbox.\\n\\nFor example, the email from Threadless could have gone one step further by saying, “We miss you, Sam!”\\n\\nSince these details depend on what your audience responds to, try testing different variations and find that sweet spot.\\n\\nRe-engagement email content\\n\\nMost re-engagement emails’ content is short – generally just two or three paragraphs. All you need to do is to make the purpose of your email clear: “Do you still want to get emails from us?”\\n\\nThen, you might consider explaining the value your emails provide.\\n\\nRemember , these are people who signed up to receive messages from you but at some point stopped reading.\\n\\nThey wanted to hear from you before, so how can you get them re-interested in what you have to say?\\n\\nAsk yourself a few questions:\\n\\nWhat did my subscribers sign up to receive originally?\\n\\nAm I continuing to send them content based on their original expectations?\\n\\nDid I change anything in my email strategy that might have caused them to stop engaging with my content?\\n\\nWhat can I offer to pique their interest again?\\n\\nOnce you have those answers in mind, it’s time to start writing your email.\\n\\nHere’s an example of a re-engagement email we sent to our inactive blog newsletter subscribers:\\n\\nThe format is simple, and it makes a good template for any re-engagement email:\\n\\nYou haven’t opened any emails from us in a while\\n\\nWe want to make sure you’re still interested\\n\\nClick this button to stay on the list\\n\\nHere’s what you can expect if you remain on the list\\n\\nThat’s all you have to say in a re-engagement email–just one sentence and a few bullet points. After all, the shorter your email is, the more likely people are to read it and click the button.\\n\\nGetting inactive subscribers up to speed might also help get them re-interested in your content. So, consider adding a short bulleted list of your recent “greatest hits,” such as:\\n\\nProducts\\n\\nContent\\n\\nPromotions\\n\\nRe-engagement email incentives\\n\\nSpeaking of promotions, offering an incentive, like a white paper or coupon code, might also help you re-engage subscribers.\\n\\nIf you hooked them onto your list with a piece of content in the past, consider how you might be able to repeat that success during your re-engagement email campaign.\\n\\nCheck out this example from Paperworks, a stationary and premium paper provider:\\n\\nOffering a special discount is a great way to get subscribers interested in your emails again.\\n\\nNot only are you giving your subscribers something in exchange for their time and attention, but you might even get another sale out of it as well.\\n\\nRe-engagement email feedback\\n\\nTo help you learn more about why subscribers grew disinterested in your content, asking them for specific feedback could help fill in the gaps. For example:\\n\\nWas there something you could have done better for these subscribers?\\n\\nWhat made them stop engaging in the first place?\\n\\nAsking these questions directly can help you figure out exactly where you can improve your email marketing strategy.\\n\\nAdditionally, if you make a subscriber feel like their opinion is truly valued, they may want to stick around. Plus, this will give you valuable insight into their needs that you wouldn’t get anywhere else.\\n\\nAs you get feedback and notice common themes, you can implement their suggestions in the future.\\n\\nRe-engagement email call to action\\n\\nThe whole point of your email is to prompt subscribers to take an action, so make sure your emails have a call to action that is bold and clear.\\n\\nGenerally, you’ll want to limit yourself to one call to action in order to increase your click-through rate. However, there are exceptions to this rule.\\n\\nUltimately, your CTA should make it easy for recipients to:\\n\\nStay on or opt out of your list\\n\\nLearn more about a product or service\\n\\nDownload an incentive\\n\\nFor example, check out this email and CTA from Grammarly:\\n\\nWhile having one call to action is the classic approach, some re-engagement emails examples also include an unsubscribe link.\\n\\nFor instance, take a look at this email from a PEW, a non-profit organization:\\n\\nFinally, some re-engagement emails even let subscribers choose to get emails less often, like the example below.\\n\\n7 Re-engagement email examples\\n\\nNow that you’ve got a good idea of what goes into an effective win-back email, let’s look at some re-engagement email examples.\\n\\nThe following ideas are great ways to get customers interested in your brand again.\\n\\n1. Surveys\\n\\nIf your subscribers aren’t responding to what you’ve been sending, try asking them what they would like to get from you. After all, this can help you better understand your audience’s interests and preferences.\\n\\nFor example, you might send a re-engagement email with the subject line “We miss you! Tell us how we can improve.” Then, for your call to action, include a link to a brief survey. Consider asking questions about:\\n\\nTheir favorite types of content\\n\\nProducts they’re interested in\\n\\nHow often they’d like to hear from you\\n\\nUltimately, this feedback can help guide your future email marketing campaigns, as well as show subscribers you value their opinions.\\n\\n2. Coupons and discounts\\n\\nIf you’re in ecommerce, the classic way to win back inactive customers is to send them a juicy discount coupon.\\n\\nConsider making this a dollar off discount rather than a percent off discount. One study of win-back campaigns found that dollar off discounts activated more subscribers.\\n\\nFor instance, you could send an email with the subject line “We miss you! Here’s $10 off your next purchase.”\\n\\nThen, in the content of your email, be sure to include your discount code and a call to action directing subscribers to your store.\\n\\nYou might also think about highlighting new or popular products to entice them even more.\\n\\n3. New products and services announcements\\n\\nAnnouncements are ideal emails to send out if you haven’t mailed to your list in a few months. They’re a great opportunity to let recipients know about new products or services you’re offering.\\n\\nFor example, consider sending a re-engagement email with the subject line “Check out our new arrivals!”\\n\\nThen, in your email content, be sure to showcase your latest and greatest products with high-quality images, and include a CTA to your online store.\\n\\nBy showing off your most recent arrivals, you can recapture the interest of customers who’ve grown tired of your old line of products.\\n\\n4. Free resources\\n\\nFree resources are also excellent to send if you haven’t emailed your list in awhile.\\n\\nA high-value digital resource, like an ebook or a course, can be a great way to demonstrate that it’s worth their time to be on your list.\\n\\nFor instance, consider using the re-engagement email subject line “Exclusive free ebook just for you!” and provide a link to the download.\\n\\nYou should also be sure to highlight the value recipients will gain from the resource, reinforcing the value they’ll get if they remain active subscribers.\\n\\n5. Customer testimonials\\n\\nYou can use customer testimonials with other types of content mentioned above. For instance, share a few testimonials about a new service you have.\\n\\nThink about using a subject line like “See what others are saying about our new service!” and include direct quotes from customers.\\n\\nThis strategy can be especially effective in combination with some of the others listed above.\\n\\nFor example, including testimonials with a new service announcement or special discount can build trust and credibility while encouraging inactive subscribers to re-engage.\\n\\n6. Limited time offers\\n\\nAnother great way to win back subscribers is by inducing a sense of urgency in your emails.\\n\\nFor instance, you might offer a limited-time discount or promotion to encourage recipients to take action quickly.\\n\\nConsider using a subject line like “Limited time offer! $10 off just for you,” and include a countdown timer or specific end-date.\\n\\nBy inducing a sense of urgency, you can get customers to take action quickly.\\n\\n7. Resubscription Offers\\n\\nRe-subscription offers can be a great incentive to get subscribers interested in your product or service again.\\n\\nFor instance, you might use the re-engagement email subject line, “We want you back! Enjoy 30 days of free premium access.”\\n\\nThen, include a CTA to your sign-up page where customers can try out your platform again for a limited time for free.\\n\\nIf your product or service is delivering the value the customer desires, there’s a good chance they’ll stick around after the free trial is over.\\n\\nRe-engagement email campaign sequences\\n\\nAll email lists are different, so what works best in one situation may not work so well in another. One message might do the trick, but you could be more effective by sending two or three emails to warm people up and get them re-activated.\\n\\nSince these subscribers are already less engaged, aim to keep your campaign short. Send an email, wait a few days, and see who’s interacted with your content.\\n\\nIf they’ve clicked through to your content or stated they want to remain on your email list, then great! They can stay on your list and continue to get your awesome emails.\\n\\nHere are two re-engagement email examples that were sent a few days apart.\\n\\nThis is the first one. Notice how short it is?\\n\\nAnd here’s the next one, sent two days later:\\n\\nThe sequence of emails above is concise, and also respectful. Ultimately, even if subscribers opt not to re-engage, it’s important to consider what they want.\\n\\nThis way, if they develop interest in your products or services at a later date, you haven’t burned any bridges.\\n\\nStart winning back subscribers with a re-engagement email campaign\\n\\nIf you take the time to craft a re-engagement email campaign, there’s a good chance you can win back some subscribers.\\n\\nHowever, if some recipients haven’t responded, it may be time to say goodbye. And that’s perfectly ok!\\n\\nYou’ve done what you can to win them back, but if they don’t want to receive your emails, it’s better to let them go. Not only will they appreciate a cleaner inbox, but it’ll also help boost your email deliverability.\\n\\nUltimately, this will improve your email marketing in the long run.\\n\\nNow, we know that sometimes it can be really hard to write your emails. That’s why we created our What to Write in Your Emails guide and course, complete with 45+ email templates. It will save you hours of work every month.\\n\\nHow do you plan on running a re-engagement campaign of your own? Leave a comment below to share your ideas.\\n\\nOr, if you already have an AWeber account, watch this video to see exactly how to create and send your own re-engagement emails!\\n\\nRe-engagement email FAQs\\n\\nWhen should you send a re-engagement email?\\n\\nMany marketing experts recommend that you wait at least three to six months after a subscriber becomes inactive to send a re-engagement email.\\n\\nHowever, the proper amount of time can depend on your specific audience.\\n\\nFor example, if your content is time-sensitive or encourages frequent interaction, one to two months may be a better timeline.\\n\\nYou may even consider starting a win-back email campaign during other times.\\n\\nFor example, if you’re planning a major list cleanup, updating your product or service offerings, or notice declining engagement rates, you might want to consider sending re-engagement emails.\\n\\nUltimately, it’s key to think about the behavior and preferences of your unique subscribers, and align them with your business goals.\\n\\nHow many emails should you send in a re-engagement campaign?\\n\\nAs we mentioned earlier, there’s no perfect number of messages to send in a re-engagement email campaign.\\n\\nWhat works best for your business depends on the preferences of your specific audience.\\n\\nWhile sending just one email may be best for some brands, other brands may want to design a sequence of two, three, or even four emails.\\n\\nSo, be sure to test out some different strategies with different segments of your audience. This will help you understand how you can best win back your subscribers.'],\n",
